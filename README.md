HighslideGallery
================
HighslideGallery uses Highslide JS to enable images and YouTube videos to be 
displayed in an in-page gallery. HighslideGallery differs from other image
gallery extensions in that users have control for when an image should be 
included in a gallery, as well as being able to define seperate galleries
within the same page. Since enabling highslide occurs during the parsing phase
of saving a page, the results are also cached insted of needing to parse a page
every time before output.
