== Requirements ==

HighslideGallery requires the following:
* MediaWiki 1.17+ (previous versions have not been tested)
* Highslide JS

== Installation ==

Installation instructions are also available online:

 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:HighslideGallery
 
Extract the archive into the extensions folder in MediaWiki which should result
in a directory structure of extensions/HighslideGallery. This extension does not
include Highslide JS, which can be obtained from the following website:

 http://www.highslide.com/
 
Download the latest zip file containing the Highslide JS distribution. This 
extension uses ResourceLoader to load the javascript and CSS files, so either
the full source or the minified versions can be used. The only resources that 
are needed are the following:

* highslide/graphics (directory)
* highslide/highslide-full.js (or) highslide-full.min.js
* highslide/highslide.css

The above resources should be copied from within the highslide/ directory, into
the following location:

 extensions/HighslideGallery/modules/
 
which should result in the following:

* extensions/HighslideGallery/modules/graphics/
* extensions/HighslideGallery/modules/highslide-full.js
* extensions/HighslideGallery/modules/highslide.css

Whichever version of the Highslide JS was chosen (full source or minified), the
file needs to be renamed to '''highslide.js''' so that the ResourceLoader can 
load it.

To enable the HighslideGallery extension, add the following line to 
LocalSettings.php:

 require_once("$IP/extensions/HighslideGallery/HighslideGallery.php");
